This is a draft until 

1. I can get _index.md working so I can 
2. allow the notes to be made into pages (by 
3. removing ignorefiles = [ "geocaching/notes" ] from config.toml for the whole site)

1. Make a cache container and all that
2. Print [English](../index_en.html) and [Japanese](../index.html)
notes
